# Digital-Lock-FPGA-
This repository contains the design and implementation of a digital lock system on an FPGA. The digital lock is a combinational circuit that only opens for specific combinations of digital inputs. This project demonstrates the use of hardware description languages (HDL) such as Verilog to program an FPGA to create a secure locking mechanism.
